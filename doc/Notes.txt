========================
CROWDMIX CODING EXERCISE
========================

Done on 18/04/2015 by Guillaume Delarue
Using IntelliJ IDEA 14.1.1
Libraries used: Java 7, Maven, JodaTime, JUnit 4, Hamcrest, JMock 2, Cucumber

Uses Maven for automatic build
Published to GitHub public project: https://github.com/GuillaumeDelarue/crowdmix-coding-exercise

To run it:
* compile the sources (in src/java/gd/crowdmix) in an IDE or using the provided Maven build script
* execute Application (no parameters)

Design notes:
* As per instructions, no handling of exception for "unknown command" or any other problematic scenario is done
* Separation of concerns: the main assembly contains a command parser, an output, a time provider (system time I/O), a repository to access / modify data (all interfaces for dependency injection)
* Data classes all extend CaseClassOne or CaseClassTwo (similar to Scala case classes) that contain the members and equals/hashcode/toString
* Time Provider: to separate I/O accesses from the main business logic, system time is accessed through an interface (that also helps for testing time format, mocking time, etc.)

Testing:
* All tests can be ran using maven "test"
* Done using TDD, test coverage should approach 100% (except console output and main application)
* Used JMock 2 to mock dependencies (as interfaces)
* Acceptance testing using Cucumber and a feature file (CrowdMixScenarios.feature) - runs as part of the Maven build ("test")
* There is a dsl for unit-tests tests written in a natural way (when/then), for the repository and user details, to make them more readable
